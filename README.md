# Learn Python By Example

This tutorial teaches the basics of python 3 by example and experimentation.
The tutorials are meant to be run, read, modified and completed. For best
results, change anything and everything you are curious about.

This does not aim to be an exhaustive tour of everything there is to know about
python3, but rather a tour of the most common and important features of the
language and a fast starting point for motivated learners. For more information
check out the official python documentation at: https://docs.python.org/3/

## Preparation
There are a few things you'll need to do to get ready.
* Get this code on your computer. Check out the [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or download button.
* Make sure you have [python3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Know a few [basics of the command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDINUSK7rXE) line aka terminal.

## Getting Started
To start with a lesson, cd into its directory and run the program with eg
```
cd Inut1-Basics
python lesson1-PrintingAndStrings.py
```

After you have run the program  and understand its operation, open it in your
favorite text editor. The programs are heavily commented to explain each line
of code.

After reading through, and understanding the code, experiment by changing
anything and everything you like. Don't worry about breaking anything; that's
how you learn. You can always restore a previous version if you don't remember
how to undo your changes.

Complete the exercises at the bottom of each program to ensure you fully
understand the lesson. And finally, as you work through each unit, complete
the projects that accompany it.

## Questions and Individual Attention
Occasionally you may need additional help. You may contact me through
[my website](https://joshyorndorff.com/contact). In the future I plan to
make these lessons part of my laera project which incentive aligns teachers
and learners. I'd love to tell you more about it.
