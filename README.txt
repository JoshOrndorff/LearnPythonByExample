This does not aim to be an exhaustive tour of everything there is to know about
python3, but rather a tour of the most common and important features of the
language and a fast starting point for motivated learners. For more information
check out the official python documentation at: https://docs.python.org/3/

--- Getting Started ---

To start with a lesson, cd into its directory and run the program with

python lesson1-PrintingAndStrings.py

After you have run the program  and understand its operation, open it in your
favorite text editor. The programs are heavily commented to explain each line
of code.

After reading through, and understanding the code, experiement by changing
anything and everything you like. Don't worry about breaking anything; that's
how you learn. You can always restore a previous version if you don't remember
how to undo your changes. Finally, complete the exercises at the bottom of each
program to ensure you fully understand the lesson.

As you work through each unit, try to complete the projects that accompany it.
