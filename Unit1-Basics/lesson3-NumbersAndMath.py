# Variables do not have to contain strings of text. They can also contain
# number values.

# You still create variables with the equal sign just like before. These
# variables contain integers, or 'int's as they are called in python
cars = 9
trucks = 10

# Another numeric variable type is the floating point number, or 'float'. A
# float does not have to be a whole number. It can also be a decimal.
myHeight = 174.3
yourHeight = 181.0

# We can print ints and floats using the print() function just like strings.
print("Number of cars in the parking lot: ")
print(cars)
print("My height in centimeters: ")
print(myHeight)


# We can also do math with ints and floats.
totalVehicles = cars + trucks
heightDifference = yourHeight - myHeight

# And we can print the results.
print("Total vehicles in the parking lot: ")
print(totalVehicles)
print("Difference between our heights: ")


# Let's calculate the percentage of vehicles that are cars.
# percentCars = 


# ----------- Exercises Below -----------------

# 1. Add a print statement on line 29 to print the height difference that we
#    calculated on line 23

# 2. There are lots of other math operators such as:
#    *  for multiplication
#    /  for division
#    ** for exponentiation
#    Uncomment line 32 and compute the percentage of vehicles that are cars
#    then print the result.
